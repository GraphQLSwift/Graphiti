## Getting Started

An overview of GraphQL in general is available in the
[README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the
[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql). That overview
describes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](Tests/GraphitiTests/StarWarsTests/)
in this repository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk
through that README and the corresponding tests in parallel.

### Using Graphiti

Add Graphiti to your `Package.swift`

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/GraphQLSwift/Graphiti.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1),
    ]
)
```

Graphiti provides two important capabilities: building a type schema, and
serving queries against that type schema.

First, build a Graphiti type schema which maps to your code base.

```swift
let schema = try Schema<Void> { schema in
    schema.query { query in
        try query.field(name: "hello", type: String.self) { _, _, _, _ in
            return "world"
        }
    }
}
```

This defines a simple schema with one type and one field, that resolves
to a fixed value. More complex examples are included in the [Tests](Tests/GraphitiTests/) directory.

Then, serve the result of a query against that type schema.

```swift
let query = "{ hello }"
let result = try schema.execute(request: query)
print(result)
```

Output:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "hello": "world"
    }
}
```

This runs a query fetching the one field defined. The `execute` function will
first ensure the query is syntactically and semantically valid before executing
it, reporting errors otherwise.

```swift
let query = "{ boyhowdy }"
let result = try schema.execute(request: query)
print(result)
```

Output:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 1,
                    "column": 3
                }
            ], 
            "message": "Cannot query field \"boyhowdy\" on type \"Query\"."
        }
    ]
}
```
